```git clone https://github.com/valerio-click/Kautilya-micro```

2. Download Arduino-HID-Plus with 

```git clone https://github.com/valerio-click/Arduino-HID-Plus```

3. run Kautilya with 

```ruby Kautilya-micro/Kautilya.rb```

4. When you selected your payload you can choose (by pressing 4) to output it in a format compatible with Arduino-HID-Plus to load it into Arduino-Micro/Leonardo platform.
